RUN:

cd to the directory containing arc and rainbow.jar.

run this:

java -jar rainbow.jar [options]

command-line options:
  --strict-arc              # don't include anarki-compatible extensions
  -f file1 ... fileN        # evaluate each file
  -e '(arc axpr)'           # evaluate arc expr (after having evaluated -f, if specified)
  -args a b c               # sets "*argv*" in the arc environment to (a b c). This option, if present, must be specified last.

  

INSTALLING FROM A BINARY DISTRIBUTION:

the binary distribution is built at build/dist/rainbow-bin.zip

unzip this file anywhere, then cd to the contained rainbow directory, and run:
